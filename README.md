## Project Motivation

This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings in Seattle and Boston to uncover insights about hosts and their impact on review scores. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between host characteristics (e.g., response rate, acceptance rate, superhost status) and review scores. This analysis can help potential hosts understand factors that contribute to higher review scores and improve their listings accordingly.
